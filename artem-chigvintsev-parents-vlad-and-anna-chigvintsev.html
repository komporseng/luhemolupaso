It was also the first time Artem’s parents met their grandson Matteo in person.</span></p><p><span>But who are Artem’s parents? Find out all about them as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Artem Chigvintsev Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Artem Chigvintsev was born to his parents, Vlad and Anna Chigvintsev. They’ve always been supportive of their son. Whether it’s taking part in dance competitions or being featured on a reality show, Vlad and Anna never asked Artem to second guess his life decisions.</span></p><p><span>Infact, Artem’s parents even agreed to be on an episode of </span><i><span>Nikki Bella Says I Do</span></i><span> where they met their grandson Matteo first the first time. In case you missed it, it’s featured on Feb 9, 2023 ep when Artem arrived in Turkey with Matteo. But although the meeting was emotional (with Anna shedding some tears), Matteo didn’t immediately open up to his grandmother.</span></p><p><span>However, he was later spotted cozied up in his grandfather’s arms (but still not accepting Anna). “Well, I guess my dad’s a charmer,” Artem said. But he wasn’t just happy because Matteo opened up to his dad, he was happy because his dad opened up to Matteo. “It’s also interesting because me growing up we’re going to like a dance competition, I’m in the front row, my daddy sat in the back, but it was different, my dad actually took the initiative to play with Mateo,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Also, Artem added, “It was a beautiful moment because I feel like he also came out of his shelter, in a way of how I remember. Seeing my Parents and Matteo together for the very first time was a very special moment.”</span></p><p><span>Artem had his child, Matteo with Nikki Bella on July 31, 2020. Two years later, the pair then got married on August 26, 2022, at the Hôtel d’Évreux. The wedding venue also held a special place in&nbsp; Artem’s heart as it was right across the Place Vendôme — where he had one of the greatest vacations of his life with his wife.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Vlad Chigvintsev, Artem Chigvintsev Father</b></h3><p><span>Vlad Chigvintsev is Artem Chigvintsev’s loving father. He’s set an example for Vlad that he hopes to live up to someday.</span></p><p><span>“Happy Father’s day Dad, thank you for all that you are and everything that you’ve taught me! I got a lot to live up to,” the star dedicated an IG post to Vlad on Father’s day 2020.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Vlad Chigvintsev Age</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Vlad was above 65 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This means Vlad couldn’t have been younger than 24 when he welcomed Artem into this world.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Vlad Chigvintsev Job</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Vlad Chigvintsev didn’t reveal his job.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, his son Artem is a dancer and reality star. Artem moved to the United States in 2003 and began his dancing career with champion ballroom dancer Giselle Peacock. He then joined </span><i><span>So You Think You Can Dance</span></i><span> season 1, and although he couldn’t win the show, he later returned for season 2 as a guest choreographer.</span></p><p><span>In September 2010, Artem once again appeared on TV as a contestant for </span><i><span>Strictly Come Dancing </span></i><span>series 8. Paired up with Kara Tointon, the duo went on to win the competition, defeating Matt Baker and his partner Aliona Vilani. Thereafter, he became a celebrity dancer on the show forms seasons 9 to 11.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, he then appeared in the 18th season of </span><i><span>Dancing with the Stars</span></i><span> as a member of the Dance Troupe, and that very year, he also got promoted to a professional dancer for the show’s 19th season. So, he stayed with the show for the next 12 seasons.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Vlad Chigvintsev On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>No, Vlad Chigvintsev isn’t on Instagram or any other social media.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Anna Chigvintsev, Artem Chigvintsev Mother</b></h3><p><span>Artem Chigvintsev says that his mother Anna Chigvintsev is the best mother in the world. She’s been supportive of everything Artem ever wanted to do.</span></p><p><span>“To the best Mom in the entire world, I was lucky enough to inherit your eyes, your patience, and your kindness, I keep hoping ill get your lie-detector capabilities too. With love from the luckiest son in the world Lublu Zelyu,” he dedicated a post to her on Mother’s day 2017.</span></p><p><span>Also, he once featured her on Women’s day on his IG post captioned, “Happy international women’s day to all the women out there but especially to this the most amazing mother, love you.”</span></p><p><span>Now, Artem’s wife also stands by Anna’s side on Artem’s Women’s day posts.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Anna Chigvintsev Age</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Anna Chigvintsev was above 60 of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She’s younger than her husband Vlad.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Anna Chigvintsev Job</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Anna didn’t talk about her job.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Anna Chigvintsev On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>As of February 2023, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>anna_.chigvintseva</span></a><span> with 542 followers.</span></p><p><span>At the time, she only had two posts — one featuring herself and the other showcasing her garden.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Do Artem Chigvintsev Parents Reside?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>In 2023, Artem Izhevsk’s parents lived in Izhevsk, Russia.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Are Artem Chigvintsev Parents Still Together?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Yes, they were still together the last we checked.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Many Children Do Artem Chigvintsev Parents Have?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Artem’s parents share two kids — Artem and his brother Anton Chigvintsev.</span></p><p><span>Find Anton on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>chigvintsevanton</span></a><span>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmqqkmrpur8einq%2BhnqnApsKMqZirnZ6pwG7Cy5qbZpmemXqius2aZJygmZzDqrrTrJyvZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./armando-mart-nez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Armando Martnez">&larr;
