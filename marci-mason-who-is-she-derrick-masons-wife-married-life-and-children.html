Marci is more than just a wonderful life partner; she is also an incredible author and activist.</strong></p><p>Today, we delve into the personal lives of Derrick Mason’s wife, learning about her wiki, age, and relationship with the former football star. Derrick Mason is a former National Football League (NFL) wide receiver from the United States. On January 17, 1974, he was born in Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>Mason attended Michigan State University before being picked by the Tennessee Oilers, who later became the Tennessee Titans, in the fourth round of the 1997 NFL Draft. Derrick Mason spent his NFL career with the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Oilers), the Baltimore Ravens, the New York Jets, and the Houston Texans.</p><p>He was praised for his quickness, route-running ability, and flexibility as a wide receiver and return specialist. Mason had a distinguished career that included two Pro Bowl selections (in 2000 and 2003).</p><p>He also set several NFL return yardage records. Throughout his career, he amassed about 12,000 receiving yards and over 70 touchdowns, making him one of the most successful wide receivers of his day. Mason announced his retirement from professional football on June 11, 2012, when he signed a one-day contract with the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Marci Mason is the ex-wife of former NFL wide receiver Derrick Mason. Marci, formerly known as Marci Townes, was born in April 1973 in Brentwood, Tennessee. She is 48 years old as of this writing. She is more than Derrick’s former life partner; she is the epitome of strength, intelligence, and compassion who graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy. Marci is a motivational speaker and author who released “Beyond the Pain” in 2015. People who read her writing are left with an indelible impression of her words.</p><h2>Wife of Derrick Mason</h2><p>Marci is not simply an author; she is also an enthralling public speaker, her remarks brimming with knowledge and enthusiasm. Her participation with the American Diabetes Association reflects her dedication to improving the lives of those impacted by the condition.</p><p>Marci’s vision is further broadened as the founder of Marci Mason Media, LLC, where she provides platforms for people to share their stories, therefore uplifting and inspiring countless lives. Her journey from the University of Detroit Mercy to the present displays determination, perseverance, and giving back. Her story shows the tenacity of the human spirit, inspiring everybody fortunate enough to meet her.</p><h2>Their Children and Family Life</h2><p>Derrick Mason’s affair with his ex-wife Marci Mason began before their wedding. After dating for several years, the couple married in the late 1990s. They are the parents of two children. Derrick and Marci’s daughter, Bailee, was born in 1999. Their family was completed in 2003 with the birth of their son, Derrick Jr. Unfortunately, they divorced after 16 years of marriage. Despite their divorce, they remained close friends and shared custody of their children.</p><p>Derrick’s children have been his primary focus since his retirement and divorce from his wife. He drove his children to school, picked them up, and supported them in their athletic and dancing activities every day. On weekends, he was a diligent parent, juggling school activities and family time while frequently playing for the Titans.</p><p>Today, he’s a present dad, enjoying his close relationship with his children, his biggest admirers, their loyalty replacing stadium yells. Mason soon became connected with Stacey, assuring her harmonious relationship with his ex-wife. It’s unclear whether the former wide receiver is still with her.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>NFL Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Donovan Smith | Journey From Street To NFl Stardom | Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</a></h3>Donovan Cole Smith is an offensive lineman for the National Football League (NFL) Kansas City Chiefs.
