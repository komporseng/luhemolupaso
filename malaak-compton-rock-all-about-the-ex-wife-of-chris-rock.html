Chris admitted that his infidelity was the reason his 18-year marriage was terminated. Chris had an addiction to porn and had cheated on his wife.</p><p>He was required to make the alimony, child support, and additional payments that his wife had requested. Nevertheless, he argued that she is capable of working and providing for the children’s needs or her support.</p><p>Chris also refuses to give Ntombi child support because, in his words, he had nothing to do with the adoption of Ntombi.

Following their divorce, Malaak and Chris both moved on with their lives. The strong, beautiful woman keeps posting pictures of herself online with her spouse.</p><p>Although she hasn’t revealed who her boyfriend is, we can reasonably conclude that they are really in love based on the postings.
