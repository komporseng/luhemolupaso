He is best known for his time with the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won two NBA championships. Cook has had an impressive career so far, with many achievements and accolades to his name.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Cook was born on March 23, 1993, in Washington, D.C. He attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he played basketball for the school team. Cook had an outstanding high school career, leading his team to a 32-4 record in his senior year and earning the title of the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference Player of the Year. He was also named a McDonald's All-American and a Parade All-American.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>After high school, Cook decided to attend Duke University to play college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils. At Duke, Cook continued to impress and was a key player for the team. In his senior year, he played a crucial role in leading Duke to the NCAA national championship title in 2015. Cook was also named to the All-ACC Third Team that year.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite his successful college career, Cook went undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft. He signed with the Canton Charge of the NBA Development League and played there for a year. Cook was eventually called up to the NBA, signing with the New Orleans Pelicans for the 2016-2017 season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Cook played for the Pelicans for just a few months before being waived and picked up by the Dallas Mavericks. He spent two seasons with the Mavericks, playing in a backup role. In 2018, Cook signed with the Golden State Warriors, becoming a key player for the team. That year, he helped the Warriors win the NBA championship, his first in the league.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Cook continued to play for the Warriors for another season, before signing with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. With the Lakers, Cook played as a backup point guard and helped the team win their 17th NBA championship in 2020. Although Cook did not play a significant role in the team's success, his contributions were appreciated by his teammates and coaches.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite his success with the Warriors and the Lakers, Cook has struggled to find a permanent spot in the NBA. He became a free agent in 2021 after being waived by the Lakers and has yet to sign with a new team. However, Cook remains optimistic and continues to work hard on his game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Quinn Cook is a talented basketball player who has had a successful career in the NBA so far. He has won two NBA championships, one with the Golden State Warriors in 2018 and one with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. Cook's journey to the NBA has not been easy, but his hard work and dedication have paid off. He remains a free agent as of 2023, but with his skills and experience, it is likely that Cook will find a new team soon and continue to make his mark in the league.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hllJ6xbr3UoqWnZZOkvKx51qKlZpuYlrqxtc6nqqGhoKh6uLXToQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billie-barker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Barker- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Height, Weight, Career">&larr;
