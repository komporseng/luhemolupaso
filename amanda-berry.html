Since one evening in Cleveland in 2003, when she was sixteen years old, she had vanished. Ariel Castro managed to capture Berry and two other females. In 2013, Amanda was able to escape, and she sent assistance to help Michelle Knight and Gina Dejesus, the other two captives, be rescued.</span></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Amanda_Berry_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Amanda Berry born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amanda Berry was conceived </span><b>on April 22, 1986.</b><span style=font-weight:400> Cleveland, Ohio, is where she was born. He had landed a job at the neighborhood Burger King, but one night as he was leaving for home from work, he vanished. Amanda was last seen on April 21, 2003, while she was under the age of 17.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Amanda’s mother Louwana Miller demanded further information about her daughter’s disappearance and dispelled any rumors that Berry had fled, Amanda was reported as missing. Miller sadly passed away in 2006, and her daughter is still unaccounted for.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He arrived on the stairs of 2207 Seymour Avenue <strong>on May 6, 2013</strong>, pleading for assistance. Angelo Cordero and Charles Ramsey came over to assist Amanda, and the two men later presented divergent accounts of their actions in breaking down the house’s door. The six-year-old accompanied Amanda.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amanda discovered a refuge nearby and dialed 911. She also reported going missing for more than ten years. DeJesus and Knight, two more women who had to vanish in the past, were captured and saved that evening by Cleveland police.</span></p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td style=width:54.4177%><b>Wiki</b></td><td style=width:44.8795%><b>&nbsp;</b></td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Full Name</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Amanda Berry</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Date of Birth</td><td style=width:44.8795%>April 22, 1986</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Birth Place</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Cleveland, Ohio</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Age</td><td style=width:44.8795%>36 years old</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Nationality</td><td style=width:44.8795%>American</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Father’s Name</td><td style=width:44.8795%>N/A</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Mother’s Name</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Louisiana Miller</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Siblings</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Beth</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Occupation</td><td style=width:44.8795%>N/A</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Body Measurement</td><td style=width:44.8795%>N/A</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Ethnicity</td><td style=width:44.8795%>White</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Zodiac</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Height</td><td style=width:44.8795%>5 feet 6 inches</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Weight</td><td style=width:44.8795%>55 kg</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Hair Color</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Black</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Eyes Color</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Black</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Children</td><td style=width:44.8795%>Jocelyn</td></tr><tr><td style=width:54.4177%>Net Worth</td><td style=width:44.8795%>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Meeting_Up_With_Family>Meeting Up With Family</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>On May 8, 2013, Amanda Berry and DeJesus were reunited with their families, and Berry’s sister Beth Serrano thanked everyone for their good wishes in a public statement. The floor had a brown knight on it. The Cleveland Courage Fund was later founded to offer services to the three women who visited the house.</span></p><h2><span id=Arrest_and_Death_of_Castro>Arrest and Death of Castro</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>52 individuals were detained by Castro, including the Seymour property’s owner who had been drinking while Amanda was evading. Castro allegedly subjected the women to terrible treatment, kept them imprisoned in the basement for an extended period, and allowed them to hardly ever leave. Although Amanda had a daughter by the name of Jocelyn at the time of her incarceration. She was six years old when she made her escape. Castro’s paternity was later established through a paternity test.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Castro was suspected of kidnapping Berry, DeJesus, and Knight and holding them captive in his Cleveland home while his siblings were detained but not charged. He was cited in 329 incidents, including two offensive murders for forced abortions, 139 rapes, and 177 kidnappings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amanda Berry, Knight, and DeJesus were abducted and raped by Castro, who entered a guilty plea. Castro had complained in the hopes of avoiding the death penalty. Castro was therefore given a life sentence and reclusion to jail without the possibility of parole on August 1. Knight, Amanda’s victim, was present at the trial even though she wasn’t there.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Berry’s sister, Beth Serrano, indicated that Berry doesn’t want to discuss the abuse because she is preoccupied with safeguarding her daughter. On September 3, 2013, Castro’s body was discovered inside his cell. He had used a sheet to hang himself.</span></p><h2><span id=Who_is_Amanda_right_now>Who is Amanda right now?</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the years that followed their release, Knight continued on his path, but Jesus and Amanda Berry came dangerously near to succumbing to their common temptation. Just before the saga was updated with the Lifetime feature Cleveland Abduction, they collaborated to write Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland in April 2015. At John Marshall High School in late May, they also shared honorary diplomas.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>I can go out unless I like, Amanda said on Amanda Berry News while describing the everyday pleasures she enjoys. My daughter can go to school with me. I’m free to visit my friend’s home. I’m free to eat and watch whatever I want. We look forward to the promising future that lies ahead.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amanda Berry has dedicated her life to parenting Jocelyn, but she has also made an effort to assist other families of kidnapping victims by locating the missing person and reporting them to a local television station.</span></p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Smolsprout</a>, <a href=#>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a href=#>Victoria Mercado</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebirty</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Remembering Kayla Rooney:Obituary and Death Cause</a></h3>Learn about Kayla Rooney's obituary, the reason for her premature death, how she affected her family, and the circumstances of her demise.
