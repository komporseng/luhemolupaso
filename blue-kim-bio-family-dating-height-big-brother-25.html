Like the rest, she seemed confident about her chances.</p><p>Opening up about her decision to appear on the show, Kim shared, “I want to be on Big Brother&nbsp;because&nbsp;Big Brother requires two things: Strategy and a social game, which honestly, I have both. And the money won’t hurt!”</p><p>She also shared her strategy going into the game by revealing, “My strategy going into the game is lying about my job so they don’t know I’m a strategist, winning the competitions, and playing a mean social game.”</p><p>Days before Big Brother Season 25 premiered, Kim took to IG and announced, “I’VE BEEN KEEPING THIS A SECRET SINCE MARCH BUT I AM EXCITED TO FINALLY ANNOUNCE THAT I AM A CONTESTANT ON THE 25TH SEASON OF BIG BROTHER.”</p><p>In the same post, Kim thanked the Big Brother team, friends, and family for their support.</p><h3><strong>Blue Kim Job</strong></h3><p>Big Brother starlet Blue Kim is a brand strategist.

She wrote, “I remember yelling at my mom to pack me a turkey sandwich (I don’t even like turkey sandwiches lol) for lunch because the kids at school would tell me how my Korean lunches smelled.
