In the caption, he simply wrote that it is hard trying to sum up their wedding day in an Instagram caption. Then, he gushed that it was “absolutely” the best day of their lives. Of course, he also cared to thank everyone who made everything so special.</p><p>Before this, the pair got engaged during the 2020 Covid lockdown. It was more of a quarantine engagement with just the two of them and their cat resent. About this, Hunter took to his Instagram a picture of him getting down on one knee on 31 December 2020. In the caption, joyously wrote, “Is there anything more 2020 than an at-home proposal? I love you @fielderjewett! Can’t wait to marry you!”.
