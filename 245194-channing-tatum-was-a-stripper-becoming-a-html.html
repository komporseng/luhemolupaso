He also made it known that he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/5twJQYqSmwc>was proud of his humble beginnings.</a></p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HE TOLD HIS STORY</strong></p><p class=dh>The actor defied the criticism of naysayers as he headlined, co-financed and starred in a movie, "Magic Mike" which centered on the eight months he spent working as a hunk in tearaway pants. The star once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/male-stripper-to-movie-star-the-evolution-of-channing-tatum-59166/>said</a> about his old-time job:</p><p class=dh>"I had wanted to tell people. I'm not ashamed of it. I'm not a person who hides [expletive]."</p><p class=dh>The movie and its sequel, "Magic Mike XXL" revolve around Channing telling his own life story and being the main character as well. Without disappointing his fans, the 40-year-old actor embodied his character with expertise.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHEN TATUM'S DAD FOUND OUT</strong></p><p class=dh>Channing's dad, Glenn, did not know about his son's old-time job until he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a39696/channing-tatum-dad-stripper-ellen-degeneres/>gave Ellen DeGeneres a lap dance</a> on the "Jimmy Kimmel Show." At the time, Channing was filling in for Jimmy Kimmel and DeGeneres was a guest.</p><p class=dh>On the show, fans watched the "White House Down" actor grind on the comedian's laps while the live audience cheered him on. One fan who watched the episode was Glenn and he was highly displeased.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Channing</a> shared in an interview that his dad did not take it well. At another time, Channing stated that he was not ashamed of his former means of livelihood, but he did not miss stripping as well.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS CHANNING TATUM?</strong></p><p class=dh>Most often than not, Hollywood fans and practitioners see a hunk with an outstanding showbiz career. They also see Channing, 40, as someone whose path took him through stripping and modeling.</p><p class=dh>However the “21 Jump Street” actor’s humble beginnings go back to when he was a kid who was diagnosed with A.D.H.D and dyslexia. Way into his teenage years, Channing <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/t-magazine/channing-tatum-foxcatcher-interview.html>discovered he could thrive in the arts</a>.</p><p class=dh>Channing, who is referred to as a “blue-collar person” is quite skilled with using his hands as he has his interest in sculpturing. He thrives in Hollywood because of house much he loves to learn whether while acting or producing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbmlpaXqktMCnpaKml2LBosDUpmSwmaNirm6%2F06ugqaiVp3qjscKopKKml2Kub7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cardi-b-daughter-4331128.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything You Need to Know About Kulture  Hollywood Life">&larr;
