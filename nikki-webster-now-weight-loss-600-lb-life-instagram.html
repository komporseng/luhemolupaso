Where is she now? Is she married now? Learn about where and what is she doing now in this article below.</p><p>This article attempts to cover it all here.</p><h3><strong>Nikki Webster On My 600-Lb Life</strong></h3><p>The cast members who have appeared in My 600-Lb life arrived on the show with trauma and stories which brought them to the state they were in then. Losing weight is no easy journey and many cast members struggled to attend their desired weight in the given time period.</p><p>However, cast member like Niki Webster is a different story and hope for many who are willing to lose weight. She appeared for the first time in the fourth season of the reality show weighing nearly 650 lbs. Sadly, she was also banned from seeing her nieces and nephews in case her weight “distressed” them.</p><p>She came into the show asking for help from Dr. Nowzaradan. She explained at the time, “My weight is debilitating. My body is so painful, I hate it. But I say this to myself. Food is an addiction to me and my addiction is killing me.”</p><h3><strong>Where Is Nikki Webster Now?</strong></h3><p>After reaching her weight of 194 pounds, Nikki spoke to PEOPLE. She revealed, “It’s hard to imagine now how I used to live. It’s just become so vastly different.” She continued by describing her new routine for coping with life’s difficulties, saying, “I’ve had to learn new coping mechanisms. I’ve had to deal with things that I just could not deal with. I would deal with those things by eating. Now I’ve just learned to deal with them in healthier ways.”</p><p>Nikki achieved triumph through treatment, radical lifestyle changes, and new coping skills. After putting on pants for the first time in more than ten years and reflecting on her experience, she eagerly and tearfully said in her update episode, “to be able to start to resemble what I felt like on the inside, it’s extremely powerful. That confidence is something to fight for. I’m excited to wake up every day and put on new clothes.”</p><h3><strong>Nikki Webster Weight Loss Journey</strong></h3><p>By the end of her episode, Niki Webster had undergone gastric bypass surgery and had lost almost 200 pounds in addition to having fulfilled the prerequisites to enroll in the demanding weight-loss program.</p><p>Later on, Nikki returned to My 600-lb Life in 2017 for a Where Are They Now segment two years after her episode aired. Even though she kept losing weight and got back to her busy lifestyle, the extra skin from the drastic weight loss was starting to get in the way. Nikki put her trust in Dr. Now out of fear of having to undergo surgery once more. Dr. Now was able to remove the majority of the excess skin in Webster’s belly, which led to a total weight loss of 450 pounds since the beginning of her journey.</p><p>While she still experiences both good and terrible days, the 38-year-old is definitely content with her marriage and her new outlook on life. She commented in a Facebook post from March 2020, “I’m thankful for those people that support and love me unconditionally—that have loved me at 650 lbs..at 200 lbs..and everything in between. Those people that have been patient with me as I learn what life is and what it’s all about.”</p><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>On the bright side, Nikki found a healthy diet and exercise routine that worked for her. “I do a lot of walking, that’s my favorite thing to do,” she revealed. “I’ll walk at least 2 to 3 miles a day or I try to. I’ll also try to do weight training and that kind of thing. I go to the gym every now and then and do </span><a style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em href=#>those sorts of things</a><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>.”</span> Nikki added it’s not always easy to stick to, though. “Consistency is the most important part of all this and if you don’t have it then it’s really difficult to be successful. While I’ve been able <a href=#>to be consistent</a>, it’s still difficult. Consistency and balance. Balancing my work, which is demanding, and balancing the social lifestyle that I have now, then balancing family… That’s the most difficult part of it all, balancing and being consistent.”<h3><strong>Is Nikki Webster On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Nikki Webster is on <a href=#>IG</a> and <a href=#>FB</a>.</p><h3><strong>Nikki Webster Husband</strong></h3><p>Social media followers of Nikki Webster were thrilled to learn that Marc Gray, the man she went on a date with in her Where Are They Now episode, not only became a regular in her life but also proposed shortly after her update show aired and the two got married on 16 December 2017 following an 8-month whirlwind affair.</p><p>The Arkansas resident said the nuptials were everything she ever dreamed of. “It was an absolutely gorgeous, sweet, and perfect day,” she gushed about the breathtaking ceremony.”</p><p>Nikki, who now goes by Nikki Gray, stated in a sweet Instagram post from 2018 that “[We] are] ridiculously and blissfully in love and pleased with married life.”</p><p>Nikki also posted her wedding day pic on her socials. She wrote, “We got married in the LDS Temple in Saint Louis. It was an absolutely gorgeous, sweet, and perfect day. If you’re ever in the St. Louis area and need your picture taken.”</p><p>The reality star also updated their time together during the period of pandemic on her socials. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>“Marc, my parents, and I are taking every precaution in social distancing,” she wrote on the post. “Marc and I have said ‘no’ to jobs, friends, dinner dates with friends, vacations, and other family members to keep [everyone] safe. Please wear a mask and help us! And help keep your family safe as well!”</span></p><p>In October 2022, Nikki took to her IG and wrote, “I mean…I feel pretty lucky. 🥰 Just a boy and his dog.&nbsp; <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#shihtzusofinstagram</a>&nbsp; <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#shihtzu</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#dogsofinstagram</a>.”</p><p>Talking about Marc, he is a director of education at Odyssey College Prep LLC since 2019.
