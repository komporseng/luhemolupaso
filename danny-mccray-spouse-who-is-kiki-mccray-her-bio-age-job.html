The two had mandatory date nights at least once a week, even if it was at their home.</span></p><p><span>Here are Kiki’s tips for a good date night — “sit at the bar for faster, more attentive service & to converse w/ new ppl.… try new food, but save room for your favs.”</span></p><h3><b>Kiki McCray Age</b></h3><p><span>Kiki McCray was reportedly born in 1988.
