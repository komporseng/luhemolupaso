As the name suggests, Next Level Chef is being touted as the “next evolution” of cooking competition shows.</p><p>So, who is Ae Southammavong apart from being an excellent chef, which, of course, she must be if she is in the show? What is her age, height, ethnicity? And most importantly, who is she dating/married to? To find out all the answers, keep reading.</p><h3><strong>Ae Southammavong On Next Level Chef</strong></h3><p>Next Level Chef would have three levels, literally. There will be three floors and each floor would have a kitchen. The top floor kitchen would have the first choice ingredients and the bottom floor would have to work with the leftovers.</p><p>The show will feature 15 chefs. The chefs will make three teams (five in each team) and compete against each other. The contestant chefs will be judged based on how well they have worked with the ingredients that they get.</p><p>Apart from Gordon Ramsey, there will be two more judges/mentors on the show Nyesha Arrington and Richard Blais. Each judge will mentor one team and the show is The Voice style team competition.</p><p>The first episode of the show was all about draft, i.e. determining which mentor picks which contestant in their teams. The elimination starts from the second episode.</p><p>In an Instagram post, Ae talked about her National TV debut and how she wanted to represent her country Laos on the big stage.
