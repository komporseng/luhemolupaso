He is a founding member of the Beach Boys and has a net worth of $20 million.</p><p>Jardine played rhythm guitar and sang lead vocals on several hit songs, including “Then I Kissed Her,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” and “Come Go with Me.” He co-wrote and sang lead on the 1978 single “Lady Lynda,” which reached #6 on the UK Singles Chart.</p><p>After the death of his bandmate Carl Wilson in 1998, Jardine was excluded from the touring Beach Boys. However, he reunited with the band for their 50th anniversary tour in 2012. The following year, he began touring with Brian Wilson’s band.</p><p>Jardine has released several albums throughout his career, including the 2001 album “Live in Las Vegas” with his group Endless Summer Band and the 2010 solo album “A Postcard from California.” He also published a children’s book, “Sloop John B: A Pirate’s Tale,” in 2005.</p><p>In 1988, Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Beach Boys, and in 2019, he was inducted into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Formation_of_The_Beach_Boys>Early Life and Formation of The Beach Boys</span></h2><p>Al Jardine was born in Lima, Ohio in 1942 and grew up in Rochester, New York. His family later moved to San Francisco and then to Hawthorne, California where he attended Hawthorne High School and played football. It was there that he met Brian Wilson, the backup quarterback and future bandmate.</p><p>After graduating high school, Jardine briefly attended Ferris State University before returning to California to attend El Camino College. It was during this time that he and Wilson formed the Beach Boys in 1961 with Brian’s brothers, Carl and Dennis Wilson, and their cousin Mike Love.</p><h2><span id=Al_Jardines_Career_Highlights>Al Jardine’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Al Jardine was an original member of The Beach Boys, playing upright bass on their first recording, “Surfin'” (1961). He left the band in early 1962 but returned full-time in the fall of 1963 and sang lead on the 1965 hit “Help Me, Rhonda.” Jardine urged the band to record a cover of “Sloop John B,” which became a worldwide hit and was ranked #276 on “Rolling Stone” magazine’s 2011 list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.” In 2010, Jardine released his debut solo album, “A Postcard from California,” featuring Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Neil Young, and other musicians. Jardine has also toured with Brian Wilson in celebration of the 40th anniversary of “Pet Sounds” and performed on his 2015 solo album “No Pier Pressure.” He took part in Brian’s “Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour” from 2016 to 2019. In 2021, Jardine released a CD single featuring two songs, “Jenny Clover” and “Waves of Love 2.0,” with some of the proceeds going to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen. In 2022, he announced the “Family & Friends Tour” featuring his son Matt and Brian’s daughters Carnie and Wendy Wilson.</p><p>However, Jardine’s relationship with the Beach Boys has been contentious. He was ousted from the touring version of the band after Carl Wilson’s death in 1998, and he was later sued by Mike Love for using the Beach Boys name. The courts ruled in favor of Love, but Jardine appealed the decision and eventually settled out of court in 2008. Despite the legal disputes, Jardine has continued to perform and record music, often collaborating with his fellow Beach Boys members.</p><h2><span id=Marriages_and_Children>Marriages and Children</span></h2><p>Al Jardine married Lynda Lee Sperry on February 9, 1964. They had two sons, Matthew and Adam, before divorcing in February 1984.</p><p>On March 24, 1984, Jardine married Mary Ann Helmandollar. They had twin sons, Robert and Andrew, in 1986.</p><h2><span id=Accolades_and_Awards>Accolades and Awards</span></h2><p>In 2001, Jardine was nominated for a Grammy for Best Long Form Music Video for “Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story,” which he shared with other members of the band. The Beach Boys were also presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They received an Award of Merit at the 1988 American Music Awards and were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. In 1980, the band was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCty2ahmqqUnrumec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./branson-3515r-tractors-specs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Branson 3515R Tractor Price, Specs &amp;amp; Key Features 2022">&larr;
