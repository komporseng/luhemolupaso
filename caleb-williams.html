He is putting in a lot of effort in his job since he wants to make a solid career for himself.</p><h2><span id=Caleb_Williams-_Professional_Career>Caleb Williams- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Williams started his true freshman season at Oklahoma as the backup quarterback behind Spencer Rattler until taking over as the starter midway through the Sooners’ sixth game of the season, a rivalry game against the Texas Longhorns. Oklahoma was down 17-35 in that game when Williams entered and led the Sooners to a 55-48 victory. Williams had 212 yards throwing and two touchdowns, as well as 88 yards rushing and one touchdown. The next week, against Texas Christian University, Williams got his first start and threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for 66 yards and a touchdown in a 52-31 victory for Oklahoma. Caleb Williams, the No. 4 Sooners’ true freshman quarterback, has had an immediate impact on college football since taking over the starting job.</p><p>Williams has 11 touchdowns in just over two and a half games as a starter. Eight of those touchdowns have come through the air, including a four-touchdown throwing performance against TCU in a 52-31 win two weeks ago. With his dual-threat abilities, the Washington, D.C. native consistently demonstrated his worth. Williams has scored a 40-yard or longer touchdown run in each of the Sooners’ last three games, including a 66-yarder against Texas that solidified his spot in college football. Williams has 679 throwing yards after completing 49 of 68 throws (72 percent) against Texas, TCU, and Kansas. He has run for 224 yards on 21 carries in those contests. As a result, Williams’ name is still associated with the Heisman Trophy.
