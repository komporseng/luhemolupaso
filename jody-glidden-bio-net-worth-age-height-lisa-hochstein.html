But now, we are almost convinced that the two are an item as Lisa and Jody have come out to a glamorous date night to welcome 2023.</span></p><p><span>So, who is Lisa’s rumored boyfriend? This Jody Glidden Bio explores his life.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Jody Glidden, Lisa Hochstein Rumored Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden first came to the spotlight as Lisa Hochstein’s rumored boyfriend back in October 2022, after the duo was spotted getting cozy at </span><i><span>Catch Steak </span></i><span>in New York City. “There was a lot of canoodling at the table,” a spy shared. Later, the pair even departed the hotspot holding hands.</span></p><p><span>However, despite the overt PDA, Lisa, at the time, denied that she was dating Jody. In her words, “He’s my friend. I’m not, like, dating anyone seriously at all. Like, you know, of course, I have friends. I meet people. I’m, you know, I’m not dead.”</span></p><p><span>But the rumored boyfriend/girlfriend again showed up on a glamorous date night on January 1, 2023, at the Versace Mansion in Miami Beach. So, this definitely meant that something was up — either the two started dating after Halloween, or the two were keeping things casual.</span></p><p><span>For the Jan 1 occasion, Lisa y styled her long, blonde hair in loose waves and woe high heel platform sandals while Jody stepped out in black pants, a white shirt, and a maroon velvet jacket with burgundy-toned shoes.</span></p><p><span>Prior to romancing out with Jody, the </span><i><span>Real Housewives of Miami</span></i><span> star was married to Lenny Hochstein for 12 years.</span></p><p><span>According to her former husband, they “contemplated divorce for the last several years” before filing for divorce in May 2022. Also, he mentioned that he tried his best to avoid the divorce for the sake of their children. But since the two were “living separate lives,” separation was inevitable.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Lisa has a completely different story to tell. She claimed that she was caught off-guard by what had transpired. The star blamed Lenny’s new romance for taking away her happiness, her husband, and her best friend.</span></p><h3><b>Jody Glidden Wife</b></h3><p><span>Unlike Lisa, Jody Glidden’s past married life is a mystery. But it was reported that his ex-wife is Trish Rueda (Houlahan) — Sr Director of People Operations of </span><i><span>Introhive</span></i><span>, Jody’s company.</span></p><p><span>According to her Linkedin, Trish has been working for </span><i><span>Introhive</span></i><span> ever since Jan 2012. There, she’s overseen the day-to-day HR projects for a rapidly scaling AI company with focused efforts on employee engagement, retention strategies, and continually improving the organizational culture for over a decade.</span></p><p><span>Prior to this, Jody worked at </span><i><span>Brainware</span></i><span> (now </span><i><span>Lexmark</span></i><span>) for a year, and at </span><i><span>Reveal MedSpa</span></i><span> for 3 years.</span></p><p><span>Find Trish on FB @</span><a href=#><span>trish.glidden</span></a><span> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>trishhoulahan</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Jody Glidden Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden flaunted a stunning net worth of above $25 million in 2022. Well, he is the CEO of and founder of</span><i><span> Introhive</span></i><span>, a fastest growing B2B revenue acceleration solution.</span></p><p><span>His company was recently recognized as a category leader in Sales Intelligence and data quality management software by G2 Crowd, a top 10 fastest-growing technology company in Deloitte’s Fast 50 Awards three years in a row, and the MarTech 2020 Breakthrough Award winner for Best CRM Innovation.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Jody started the company with just two employees — Rueda and Mike Waugh. The next year, he then opened the first office and expanded its employees to 35. Within 2 years, the company was recognized worldwide and now the number of Hivers employed by the company is over 350.</span></p><p><i><span>Introhive </span></i><span>is the 4th company Jody has been involved in founding and building. The prior three were</span><i><span> Chalk Media, icGlobal</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Scholars.com</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, Jody Glidden graduated from </span><i><span>Harvard University</span></i><span> with an engineering degree in 2011. Also, he’s attended the </span><i><span>University of New Brunswick</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Miramichi Valley High School</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Jody Glidden Salary At Introhive</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden paid himself a stunning salary of $1.5 million a year at </span><i><span>Introhive</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, by 2021, the company had already raised over $135 million in funding. So, it only makes sense Jody got paid his fair share.</span></p><h3><b>Jody Glidden Age</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden was 49 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He is 9 years older than Lisa Hochstein.</span></p><h3><b>Jody Glidden Height</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden stands tall at a height of above 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his district features, Jody has hazel eyes and an intimidating body.</span></p><h3><b>Jody Glidden Family</b></h3><p><span>Jody Glidden inherits the talent for entrepreneurship from his family. “Seeing my parents start their own businesses, and being a part of them from a young age is one of the number one reasons I knew I wanted to start a business,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Also, the millionaire confessed that none of his family members has a regular job. “My dad, mom, and older siblings were all entrepreneurs. I even moonlighted as my sister’s beauty model back in the day,” he added.</span></p><p><span>But almost them, it was his mother who instilled in him the importance of constantly learning. She was also his first investor when he opened up a neighborhood pool hall and arcade for the summer at 15.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we don’t have the names of his family members except for Patricia M Glidden and Joe Glidden.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Jody Glidden Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Jody receives his birthday wishes on September 9 and is of the Virgo zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Jody Glidden From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Jody hails from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.
