Jeezy had her third child, Amra Nor Jenkins, with her wife, Mahlet Gebregiorgis. According to reports, Mahlet has a strained connection with Jeezy. Recently, the rapper married Jeannie Mai and is expecting his fourth child with her.</p><h2><strong>Jadarius Jenkins and his Mother</strong></h2><p>According to the <a href=#>source</a>, Jeezy has a kid named Jadarius, whom he shares with ex-wife Tenesha Dykes. Tenesha and Jadarrius have a strong relationship as a mother and son, and they are often seen enjoying one other’s company. Jeezy was detained in September 2012 after an incident with one of his sons, but it was unclear if it included Jadarius or Shyheim.</p><p>44 years old rapper allegedly pushed the child through a door and threatened to murder him. Jeezy surrendered to authorities and paid a $45,000 bail. According to People, Jadarius was involved in an altercation in Warner Robins, Georgia, in December 2018, resulting in a “severe” cut to his face. Jadarius allegedly received medical care for his injuries and appeared to have recovered completely.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4068 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jadarius-Jenkins-son-of-young-zezzy.jpg alt="Jadarius Jenkins with his father, Young Jezzy" width=908 height=545 sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4068 class=wp-caption-text>Jadarius Jenkins with his father, Young Jeezy</p><h2><strong>Death Rumor of Jadarius Jenkins</strong></h2><p>Dyersburg Police are looking into two tragic, violent incidents that occurred within three hours of one other early Saturday, August 28. Officers were summoned to the Chequers pub in response to a stabbing. When they arrived, the police discovered four persons with stab wounds in the parking lot due to a brawl after they left the pub.</p><p>All four victims were taken to a neighboring medical institution in private automobiles. According to police, one of the victims, 22-year-old Jadarius Jenkins, died as a result of his injuries, while the other three sustained serious injuries, reported a piece of<a href=#> news portal</a>. Their current circumstances are unclear.</p><h2><strong>Shyheim Jenkins Parents</strong></h2><p>Shyheim is Jeezy’s second kid, and he does not receive the same amount of attention as Jadarius. The facts regarding his mother are unclear; however, it has been reported that he has the same mother as Jadarius, Tenesha. Details regarding his personal life are rarely widely discussed in the media, and he is perceived to be a highly private and discreet guy.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4069 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jeezy-and-second-son-Shyheim-Jenkins.jpg alt="Shyheim, Jeezy's second kid" width=687 height=523 sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4069 class=wp-caption-text>Young Jeezy with his second son, Shyheim Jenkins</p><h2><strong>Daughter, Amra Nor Jenkins, and her Baby Mama</strong></h2><p>The American rapper is seen very much connected with his third child, Amra Nor Jenkins. She is his only daughter, and he is pretty attached to her. The lucky daughter was born in the year 2014. She is the daughter of Jeezy and Mahlet Gebregiorgis. Her mother is a famous musician and is widely known by the name Mahi.</p><p>Her mother does not have a good relationship with her father, so they are seen to avoid the spotlight together. The daughter acts as a connection and bridge between the parents. They were involved in a tumultuous custody fight for Amra, which was allegedly concluded with the rapper paying $7,500 in child support plus $30,000 for school tuition.</p><p>However, the ex-couple returned to court in 2020 when Mahi accused Jeezy of failing to pay his custody arrangement. According to sources, Jeezy disputed this and even accused Mahi of manipulating events out of “bitterness” about Jeezy’s relationship with Jeannie. The court case’s fate is presently uncertain.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-4070 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Daughter-Amra-Nor-Jenkins.jpg alt="Young Jeezy with his small daughter, Amara Nor Jenkins" width=520 height=504 sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-4070 class=wp-caption-text>Young Jeezy with his small daughter, Amra Nor Jenkins</p><h2><strong>Jay Wayne is expecting a fourth child with his partner, Jeannie Mai</strong>.</h2><p>In the year 2021, Jeezy and Jeannie Mai married in their Atlanta house.

His work and dedication have rewarded him well, and his net worth is estimated to be around $10 million. Despite his popular success, Young Jeezy claims that he has never put fame and riches before his music.</p><p>According to Jeezy, his major focus was spreading his message and getting known in the streets, both of which he has achieved.
