It wasn’t until her debut as Gabriella Montez in High School Musical&nbsp;that she began to become a household name. While auditioning for the hit Disney musical, Vanessa met her co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a>, 36, and the two began a romance shortly thereafter. After their split in 2010, Vanessa&nbsp;went on to date numerous actors and athletes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On December 4, 2023, news broke that Vanessa <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> to MLB star <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cole Tucker</a>&nbsp;</strong>after a three-year romance.&nbsp;From Zac to her long-term romance with Elvis star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Austin Butler</strong></a> and onto her exciting marriage news,&nbsp;find out more about Vanessa’s past and present loves here!</p><h2>Zac Efron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Hudgens-Boyfriends-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Zac and Vanessa first met and began dating after co-starring together on the hit Disney musical&nbsp;High School Musical&nbsp;— a franchise that catapulted both of their careers and made them into one of the most beloved Disney couples of all time. Opening up on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter‘s Awards Chatter</a>&nbsp;podcast in 2019, Vanessa shared how “grateful” she was to have dated Zac early in her career.&nbsp;“It’s just a really weird foreign thing to go through, and by being in a relationship, I feel like it kind of kept me stabilized and grounded, and I had someone to lean on who was going through it as well,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The couple ultimately went their separate ways in 2010, with a source telling&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!&nbsp;online</a> at the time that the relationship simply “ran its course.” After Vanessa broke things off with her next serious boyfriend, Austin Butler, in 2019, HSM&nbsp;fans rooted for her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to reunite with Zac</a> — even causing their nickname “Zanessa” to trend on Twitter. As nostalgia-inducing and sweet as it might be for them to find love again a decade after splitting, a reunion is unlikely. During a 2017 appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Access Hollywood Live</a>, when asked if she talked to Zac much, Vanessa replied, “Um no. I’ve completely lost contact with him.”</p><h2>Josh Hutcherson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Hudgens-Josh-Hutcherson-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Vanessa was linked to&nbsp;actor&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Josh Hutcherson</a>&nbsp;</strong>in early 2011, after the pair had co-starred together in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. “I don’t know if ‘dating’ is the right word,” Josh told&nbsp;Seventeen&nbsp;magazine later that year when describing his relationship to the&nbsp;Spring Breakers&nbsp;actress. Although their relationship wasn’t officially confirmed, they did <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>awkwardly and indirectly announce their split</a> on Australia’s TODAY while promoting their film in early 2012. “We were [going out] at one point,” Josh said in the clip, “but she broke my heart — no I’m just kidding.” The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hunger Games</a>&nbsp;star then clarified that they were romantically linked “at one point,” but now remain “just friends.”</p><h2>Austin Butler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Hudgens-Austin-Butler-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Austin Butler&nbsp;was Vanessa’s next serious boyfriend after Zac, as the two dated for nearly nine years. Vanessa and the&nbsp;Carrie Diaries&nbsp;star were first linked in Sept. 2011 and then made their debut as a couple at the Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&nbsp;premiere in Feb. 2012. Vanessa, however, didn’t officially confirm their relationship until 2014 — nearly two years later — when she posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet Instagram tribute</a> to her beau, calling him “the love of my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The pair sparked breakup speculation in 2019 after not spending the holidays together. One month later, they officially parted ways. “Vanessa and Austin are officially broken up, and Vanessa has been telling those close to her about their breakup,” a source revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;at the time of the split.</p><h2>Kyle Kuzma</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Hudgens-Kyle-Kuzma-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Princess Switch</a>&nbsp;star was briefly linked to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle</strong> <strong>Kuzma</strong></a>, 28, in Jan. 2020, as the two were spotted out on a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brooklyn dinner date</a> just seven days after she split from Austin. Kyle is a basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers, and Vanessa was also photographed watching him play courtside at a home game in LA. Their romance was short-lived, however, and didn’t really manifest into anything beyond a brief fling.</p><h2>Cole Tucker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Vanessa-Hudgens-Cole-Tucker-SS-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Vaness has been with Cole Tucker <span>since they were first photographed getting cozy in Nov. 2020</span>, and the two seem <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>happier than ever</a>. The pair made things Instagram official on Valentine’s Day 2021 when Vanessa posted a photo of the two kissing and wrote, “<span>It’s you, it’s me, it’s us.” Cole is a professional baseball shortstop and outfielder for the Colorado Rockies.&nbsp;</span>On February 2, 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported that Vanessa and Cole had gotten engaged. A source told the outlet that he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>popped the question</a> sometime late in 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Vanessa and Cole’s marriage made the news on December 4, 2023. The couple reportedly tied the knot in a wedding ceremony in Tulum, Mexico. Vanessa was seen wearing a white gown on the beach during the wedding weekend.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>An insider dished EXCLUSIVELY to <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>about Cole and Vanessa <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back in April of 2021</a>.&nbsp;“Cole treats Vanessa like a queen, he adores her. People were a little skeptical of him at first. I mean, a pro athlete and he’s only in his early twenties, no one really expected it to last,” the source shared with HL. “But he has been very serious about her from the get-go and that has not wavered. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>He adores her</a> and says all the time that she is his dream girl, it’s sweet.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The insider went on, “Vanessa is very taken with him too. Last month she went to see him while he was at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spring training in Florida</a>. All the other wives and girlfriends were very welcoming, she had a blast,” they shared. “It’s a new experience for her, she’s used to guys that are in the business, so she really loves that Cole is different that way. It’s a whole new world for her to join. She’s definitely in love and very, very happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9WapZ6ro5Z6qcHDoJynq12XvLqy0aKcp5yjYrGiwMinnmagmajBsL7YZmtucGRlg3V7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-miss-america-evening-gowns-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of The Stunning Dresses  Hollywood Life">&larr;
